# Principal Component Analysis

## Introduction
The main idea of *Principal Component Analysis* is to select the axis to map, in which the distribution of sample points is the largest. This method can reduce the dimension and minimize the loss of information. The PCA method treats the face image area as a random variable. Therefore, the K-L transform can be used to obtain the orthogonal transform base, and the substrate corresponding to the larger eigenvalue has a shape similar to a human face. The PCA utilizes a linear combination of these primitives to describe and cast a new face, so it can be used for face recognition and reconstruction.
